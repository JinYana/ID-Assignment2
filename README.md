Project Name: Locator

The website is a site that will help users locate the nearest parking lot in their area. The goal is to make the site easy to use and self explanatory while also making the process quick and simple. The website will be using an API provided by the singapore land transport authority(LTA)

Design process:
Firstly I picked a bootstrap template off the internet called 'Company' from a website called 'BootstrapMade". The reason I chose this template is because I thought it did a good job at clearly displaying important infomation on screen.

User stories:
As a site createor I want people to use my site as a main way for they to find parking lots

As a user I want to be able to use the website to find parking lots near me with ease

Features:
-introduction on the website, icluding insructions on how to use it
-A place for users to input their location
-A map showing the nearby carparks
