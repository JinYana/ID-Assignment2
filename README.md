# ID-Assignment2
# Project Name: Locator

The website is a site that will help users locate the nearest parking lot in their area. The goal is to make the site easy to use and self explanatory while also making the process quick and simple. The website will be using an API and a CSV file which I converted to JSON provided by the data.gov.sg website as well as a google map api

## Design process
Firstly I picked a bootstrap template off the internet called 'Company' from a website called 'BootstrapMade". The reason I chose this template is because I thought it did a good job at clearly displaying important infomation on screen.

### User stories:

As a user I want to be able to use the website to find parking lots I want to go to with ease

### Features:
-introduction on the website, including insructions on how to use it
- A live search bar that shows results as users type
- A map showing the nearby carparks
- Navigation menu at the top of the page
- Website is responsive
- Form for newsletter requires email
- Collapsible Hamburger Mobile Menu
